# Web UI Architecture

Architecture is the decisions your make about your app

Good architecture

* Minimal boilerplate code
* Curated library of tools
* Obvious ways of accessing anything \(patterns\)
* Clear implementation and style patterns
* Balance of performance and maintenance 

Architecture should:

* Provide libraries, utilities, code, content to the user \(end-user/dev\) where is needed and when is needed
* Verify its own health
* Provide an optimized version of itself

Architecture diagrams

* Simple
* Objects, events, UI
* How things connect
* Sequencing

Architecture:

* cataloguing objects
* Diagramming states
* Interactions
