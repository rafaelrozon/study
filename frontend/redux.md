# Redux

## Dev lessons

1. Actions, selectors, and reducers change for the same reasons. Keep them together. Together is not in the same file, but close. 
2. Minimize changes to API responses that are saved to the redux state. At maximum, normalize them. Use selectors to get data in a different shape.
3. In redux state separate app data from UI data
