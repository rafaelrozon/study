**What does a doctype do?**

The doctype `<!DOCTYPE html>` is found at the very top of an HTML document, it's there for legacy reasons and is used to prevent the browser from entering in "Quirks Mode". There are 3 modes that browsers can operate: quirks mode, almost standards mode, and full standards mode. Quirks mode is a mode that the browser enters and the "layout emulates nonstandard behaviour in Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 5". So, it's just not a good idea. Almost standards mode is when only some quirks are implemented. Full standards mode means that the browser will interpret HTML according to the specification.
