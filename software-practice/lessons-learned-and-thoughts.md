# Lessons Learned & Thoughts

* Do first what is most impactful in the organization for the end-users and the team
* Devs shouldnâ€™t need to convince product owners/managers of required improvements or maintenance that needs to be done. What can be discussed is the sequence of actions/tickets. The allocation of time for improvement of the systems needs to be there.
* Do design sessions before coding
* Draw solution before coding 
* Don't book meetings without an agenda of items to discuss. See [Meeting Agenda Template](../templates/meeting-agenda.md).
