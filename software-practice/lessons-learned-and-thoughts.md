# Lessons Learned & Thoughts

1. Do first what is most impactful in the organization for the end-users and the team
2. Devs shouldnâ€™t need to convince product owners/managers of required improvements or maintenance that needs to be done. What can be discussed is the sequence of actions/tickets. The allocation of time for improvement of the systems needs to be there.
3. Do design sessions before coding
4. Draw solution before coding
