# Problems & Solutions

### The t**eam is not completing tasks in the sprint**

1. Have a design session before grooming.
   1. Reason: provide a better estimate by understanding better the problem or task
2. Review stories at least a couple of times
3. Break stories in decoupled sub-tasks
4. Compare the velocity from the previous release and pull in the same amount

### **Tasks Dependencies**

Try to avoid creating tasks that depend on each other in terms of code. For example, if task 2 comes after task 1 and task 2 was branched off of task 1 if something happens and we canâ€™t deploy task 1, then everything will get stuck.
