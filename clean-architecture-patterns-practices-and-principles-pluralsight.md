# Clean Architecture: Patterns, Practices, and Principles \(Pluralsight\)

* What is software architecture?
  * High level
  * structure
  * layers
  * components
  * relationships
* Levels of architectural abstraction \(from high level to low level\):
  * System
  * sub-system
  * layers
  * components
  * classers
  * data and methods
* Bad Architecture
  * complex
  * incoherent
  * brittle
  * not testable
  * rigid
* Good architecture
  * simple
  * understandable
  * flexible
  * emergent
  * testable
  * maintainable
* Clean architecture is designed for the inhabitants \(developers and end users\) of the architecture, not the architect or the machine
* Why
  * Focus on the essential
  * Build only what is necessary
  * Optimize for maintainability
* Context is king
* all decisions are trafeoffs
* align with business goals
