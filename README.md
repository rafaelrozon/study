# Introduction

My name is Rafael Rozon and these are my notes on anything related to Software Development. It is a living collection of thoughts, learnings, cheatsheets, etc on all things I have worked on and things I am learning.

### Learning in Public

The first time I heard about _Learning in Public_ was in [You Can Learn A Lot For The Low Price Of Your Ego With Shawn Wang](https://kentcdodds.com/chats-with-kent-podcast/seasons/01/episodes/you-can-learn-a-lot-for-the-low-price-of-your-ego-with-shawn-wang) podcast episode of [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/). It made total sense to me and it was something I was already trying to do but did not have a name for it and I was lacking some guidance. So, I decided to really put it into practice and this repo/gitbook came into existence.  I decided to make it public hoping to help others in the process of making myself a better professional.
