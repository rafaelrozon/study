# Web Typography

## Course: [How to Look at Type: Fundamentals of Web Typography](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/How-to-Look-at-Type-Fundamentals-of-Web-Typography/246544835) by Jason Santa Maria

* 2 differences between graphic and web typography:
  * the web is a variable medium: different screen sizes for the same typeface
  * performance matters for web
* Type needs to be legible \(can they identify the letter forms\) and readable \(do they want to read it?\)
* Typeface vs Font
  * Typeface: work of art. 
  * Font: the implementation of the typeface
* Technical Considerations:
  * Size of your font files
  * Size of your type
* Font file formats
  * WOFF: web open font format
  * investigate about other file formats

### Contrast

* Typefaces with fewer contracts have very even widths.
* Typefaces with a lot of contrast may be difficult to read in the text, because they need to get very small.
* x-height: the size of the lower case letter against the size of the capital letters. More x-height help with legibility because there is more body.
* Qualities of "Workhorses" typefaces:
  * high enough x-height
  * recognizable letterforms
  * legible at various sizes

### Choosing typefaces

* check
  * find Jason on Pinterest
  * type news
  * fonts in use website
  * okaytype.com/harriet/series
* Inspiration:
  * sans-serif:
    * frerejones.com/families/mailory \(good for small text\)
    * Proxima Nova \(alternative to Helvetica\)
  * monospaced
    * Input \(input.fontbureau.com\)
  * Freight:
    * super family of typefaces
    * fontshop.com
* When choosing typefaces check for:
  * good x-height
  * open letterforms \(good counter space\)
  * italic looks enough like italic, same for bold
* Process:
  * define the attributes/qualities/adjectives of what we want to vehiculate with the design, for example: elegance, fun, sexy, strong, etc. 
* Sites to search for typefaces:
  * Typekit
* Typefaces pairing:
  * go for contrast
  * different typefaces support different weights
* How to chose:
  * Have a page with sample texts that include everything you'll need to account for: headings, body, lists, etc
  * Make variations of this content in different typefaces

### Layout: Sizing & Space

* the longer the line length, the more line height it will need to help guide the eye to the next line
* 45 to 75 characters per line
* hierarchy: the order that people read
