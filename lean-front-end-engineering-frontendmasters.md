# Lean Front-end Engineering - FrontendMasters

[http://billwscott.com/share/presentations/2012/fews/ws.pdf](http://billwscott.com/share/presentations/2012/fews/ws.pdf)

The more process you have, the less talent \(at the company\) you have.

Fewer people, fewer communication problems.

Fight the creation of process.

Use a process as a mean to an end, not a thing in itself.

Netflix

* Only customer is the member \(no internal customers\)
* Rarely talked about the "machine". Talked about members
* Culture
  * Rapid experimentation vs long shelf life
  * Get it out as fast as possible
  * Fail fast/learn fast
  * Don’t over think it
* 90% or more of the UI code was thrown away every year
* Follow Build-Test-Lear
* Design for volatility
* Design for throwaway-ability

Design for volatility

* "having enough components will create reuse and then the nirvana". The problem with that is that we’re not trusting the developers to take decisions. We’re creating processes and up front design that are far away from the users
* Build for great user experiences
  * To build great user experiences, we have to build, test, and learn. And to do that we need to build for change/volatility
* Book: how buildings learn
  * Our software is always tearing itself apart, or at least it should
  * Different parts of the stack change at different velocities
  * "Use before reuse"
  * Utilize packaging or paths to capture experiments
* Talk in business terminology
* Why start with experience?
  * Stay honest and pure by having experience be the driver
  * Let the experience drive the engineering
  * Reuse is an engineering optimization. Use is what users do. Reuse is what engineers do.
* Build in rapid experimentation
  * Lots of AB tests
  * Create an environment that captures user feedback loop
* Q&A
  * Exploratory documentation
    * Use cases, use experiences, how business work, etc is very valuable

Lean UX

* Lean manufacturing
  * From the manufacturing revolution
    * Draws upon the knowledge of individuals
    * Shrinking of batch sizes
    * Just in time production and inventory control
    * Acceleration of cycle times
    * Kanban: stories aren’t complete until learnings happen
* Lean startup
  * Develop experimentation systems that allow teams to move at the speed of these systems instead of the speed of "caesar giving a thumbs up or down"
  * MVP
  * Build/test/learn
  * When to pivot \(or persevere\)
  * Kanban: simple tracking of stories; end state is validated or not
  * Small batches
* Lean UX

3 Principles of Lean UX

* Principles
  * Shared Understanding – The more understanding the less documentation.
  * Deep Collaboration – Having a strong belief that ideas come from many different voices.
  * Continuous Customer Feedback – This is the lifeblood of the team because it elimitates politics and turns a team outside-in.
* Healty product life cycle
  * Discover customer insights -&gt; define customer problems -&gt; define solution concepts -&gt; deliver & test solutions -&gt; \[back to beginning\]
